    <p>North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un has issued a rare personal apology for the killing of a South Korean official, Seoul says.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim reportedly told South Korean leader Moon Jae-in that the "disgraceful affair" should not have happened.</p>
    <p>South Korea has said the 47-year-old man was found by troops floating in the North's waters.</p>
    <p>He was then shot dead and his body was set alight, according to Seoul.</p>
    <p>It is not known what the man was doing there. The South Korean government has said he may have been trying to defect to the North but his family has denied this.</p>
    <p>The killing - the first of a South Korean citizen by North Korean forces for a decade - has caused outrage in the South.</p>
    <p>The border between the Koreas is tightly policed, and the North is thought to have a "shoot-to-kill" policy in place to prevent coronavirus from entering the country.</p>
